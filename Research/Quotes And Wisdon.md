- When people depend on you, when you made a promise, when you have a duty, all of a sudden the question of energy is not a problem. Only the attrition digs at 
Viktor E. Frankl - "So _live_ as _if_ you were _living_ already _for the second time_ and as _if_ you had acted _the_ first _time_ as wrongly as _you are_ about to act now"
 - A shift in perspective that can overcome many blocks
 - If you are blocked into your own perspective try to shift it. Another example would be: imagine it's you at the end of your life. You are now wise as you lived for so long.

Generic example for shifting perspective would be: Imagine that X and what would you do then
