Why Abortion is immoral - https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.2307/2026961
	Assumptions:
		"whether or not abortion is morally permissible stands or falls on whether or not a fetus is the sort of being whose life it is seriously wrong to end." - He assumes it is seriously wrong
	Introductions:
		- Begin the questions. Pro-abortions say the fetus is not a person so no rights, anti say the opposite
	Moral base:
		- What is wrong? Does the fetus need to attain personhood before having any rights?
		- Human life vs personhood. Do our rights depend on personhood or life?
		- Human life will try to be broad enough to contain all humans. Broad principles can embrace too much. - What about human cancer cells
		- Personhood tries to be narrow enough to exclude fetuses. Narrow principles can embrace too litle. Why is it wrong to kill children after they were born? What about the severly retarded?
		- Anti-Abortion: IT is wrong to kill human *beings*. - But what is a being? Do fetuses qualify?
		- Personhood is usually defined in terms of psychological characteristics. Which characteristics are the most important? Why should those characteristics make a difference?
		*- What about the right of someone in a coma? He is not concious why should he be kept alive? - Most likely because that is their infered will. - But the will doesn't matter. He has rights no matter his will
	Personhood definition attempt (do babies even have this?):
		The characteristics that confer commonsense personhood are not arbitrary bases for rights and duties, such as race, sex or species membership; rather they are traits that make sense out of rights and duties and
		without which those moral attributes would have no point or function. It
		is because people are conscious; have a sense of their personal identities;
		have plans, goals, and projects; experience emotions; are liable to pains,
		anxieties, and frustrations; can reason and bargain, and so on-it is
		because of these attributes that people have values and interests, desires
		and expectations of their own, including a stake in their own futures,
		and a personal well-being of a sort we cannot ascribe to unconscious or
		nonrational beings. Because of their developed capacities they can assume duties and responsibilities and can have and make claims on one
		another. Only because of their sense of self, their life plans, their value
		hierarchies, and their stakes in their own futures can they be ascribed
		fundamental rights. There is nothing arbitrary about these linkages 
	
	Morality detour - Why is killing adult humans wrong? 
	 - Is it the loss to others? Effect on society? What about hermits? Isolated people?
	 - The loss of one's life is one of the greatest losses one can suffer. The loss of one's life deprives one of all the experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments that would otherwise have constituted one's future
	   The change in my biological state does not by itself make killing me wrong. The effect of the loss of my biological life is the loss to me of all those activities, projects, experiences, 
	   and enjoyments which would otherwise have constituted my future personal life
	   ?- If the loss of one's future is what makes murdering wrong? How is the loss of the future of the fetus justified? Perhaps with the future of the parents, but what would stop the parents from killing the child after he is born?
	   ~- If wrongness of killing is because of the future experiences then euthanasia for the seriously ill is justified since their future will be agony. <Sanctity of life does not confer this>
	   ?- What if he says the deprivation of person's experinces is wrong and since the fetus is not a person it doesn't matter?
	   *- It could be said that what makes killing wrong is discontinuation of life / experiences instead of depriving. 
	      Why does the past matter? IF a person was in the past in pain but now it's fine can you kill him? The past seems irrelevant
	 - It could be said that what makes killing wrong is that people want to live. Desire. What about killing suicidals or the unconscious


Other arguments:
	- Life has values because one values it (valuer)  -  But what if I am in a moment of despair and I think my life has no value even if others see great value in it.
	- A person cannot possess the right to life unless it has the capacity to desire it's continued existence
	**- What about contraception. Is a future being denied by that. Do you have an obligation to maximize the futures. Who is being wronged? Do potential fetuses matter? And if not why do fetuses matter?
