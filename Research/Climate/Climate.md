Official name?
Climate change, global warming was only colloquially used
Modern climate change - https://sci-hub.se/10.1126/science.1090228

Terms:
	Climate forcing - physical process of affecting the climate on the Earth through a number of forcing factors. Forcing factors are  anything that drives the climate to change
	Climate sensitivity - How much will temperature change if we double the CO2 compared to preindustrial


Factors:
	Sun
		Solar iradiance - How much heat does the sun output
		Milankovitch cycles - How far is the earth 
			- Tilt of the axis of earth between 22.1 and 24.5 - Cycles every 41.000 years - Currently at 23.4 degrees and decreasing
			- Orbital eccentrity - 124.000 years cycle. How circular or elliptical it is. It is caused by Jupiter and Saturn. Currently approaching the least elliptic point(most circular)
			- Axial precession - 25k years.
			- Orbital inclination - 100.000 years. Our orbit is not circular
	Greenhouse gases:
		CO2 - Everything else - Effect 25%(https://sci-hub.se/10.1126/science.1090228)
		Metane - Cows, ice melting - ?
		Water vapour - Amplificator for the other greenhouse gases - 60%. It does not produce a positive feedback loop because it condensates back into water
		Ozone - Effect 8% https://sci-hub.se/10.1126/science.1090228
	Clouds - Linked with water vapour - a bit more controversial but is suggested that it causes warming https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByXC85Z909PTMExGWXRDdXkwdFE/view?resourcekey=0-6JQDBfqrEVD9mKgOP6tEmA
	Anti-greenhouse gases:
		Ash from volcanoes
		Asteroids and meteorites
		Industrial pollution
	El nino and La nina cycles
	Ice - Reflects sunlight - feedback loop
	
Feedback relations:
	Increase in temperature increases water vapour
	Water vapour increases clouds
	Increase in temperature increases max water content https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/maximum-moisture-content-air-d_1403.html
	Increase in temperature melts ice which reflex sunlight
	
Other factors that exasurbate it:
	Urbanization, deforestation and desertification makes it so less CO2 is absorbed
	Concrete retains a lot more heat than plants. These cause local heat in cities
	
	
How much heating?
	Between 1.7 and 4.9 at the end of 2100 (https://sci-hub.se/10.1126/science.1090228)
		
Why does Greenhouse gases produce the greenhouse effect (trap heat)?
	They block the infrared light but not the visible light. The heat radiated by the sun is in the infrared.
	Water vapour blocks different band of light than CO2. Complementing eachother
	CH4 is much more potent than CO2
	
Why will the sea level rise?
	Hotter water is less dense.
	Ice melting off the ground.
	
How can such a small percentage affect something?
	Can I put 0.04% of mercury in your coffee? Or cyanide?
	Even if the percentage is small it will have an effect, especially with the amplification mechanism the earth has
	
Why is it bad?
	More heat means more droughts
	More forest fires
	More heavy precipitation events
	
In 1970 there simply wasn't a consensus.
	
Atmosphere composition
	78% azot
	21% Oxygen
	0.93% argon
	0.04% CO2

How to tell CO2 heating from Solar heating?
CO2 increases heat at the surface while it cools it at the atmosphere
