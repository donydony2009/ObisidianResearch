#### Meta analyses

1. https://sci-hub.se/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/tesq.157 - A Meta-Analysis of Extensive Reading Research - Japan ^meta1
	- 34 studies, 3942 participants, 43 unique effect sizes (22 with group contrasts and 21 with pre-post contrast
	- this study seems to be in the context of using extensive reading as a learning method for a secondary language
	- this study is about second language learning
	- most of the people being studied were in school (junior high - university) with only ~100 being adults
	- "a strong relationship between reading speed and reading comprehension has been found in both first and second language studies of reading (e.g., Beglar, Hunt, & Kite, 2012; Nuttall, 2005). Learners who enjoy reading read faster, read more, and eventually comprehend better. Nuttall (2005) calls this the “virtuous circle of the good reader" -- *Could this be because if you are succeful at something you are more likely to repeat it*
	- Research questions:
		1. What is the strength of extensive reading instruction? 
		2. Do learners’ ages impact learning from extensive reading differently? 
		3. Does length of extensive reading instruction influence test scores? If so, how long is an appropriate period of instruction? 
		4. What kinds of tests were utilized to determine the effects of extensive reading?
	- **! This is not about speed reading but using extended reading to learn a second language. Nonetheless simply reading does seem to improve reading speed in these circumstances. But does it scale? Or do you plateau?**
	- **! The impact of extended reading can be seen across all age groups. The main area of improvement is reading speed, followed closely by comprehension. Vocabulary only marginally improved in the group studies but in the pre-post studies it improved one standard deviation (so prob it improves too).**
	- **! That being said a some stuff didn't reach the criteria of statistical significance which might indicate that it's not always the case that extensive reading helps. **
