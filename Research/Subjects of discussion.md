### Human dynamics
- Abusive dynamics
	- They can naturally occur without mallicious intention
	- Creating the expectation that the abuser will become upset will trigger the abuser to be upset. For example: "I don't want a lot for christmas I just want you. - So I am not a lot?" if the response is laughing as if it's a joke most likely response will be to laugh along. If the response is nervousness and defensiveness it can trigger the abusive pattern
	- The responsibility in an abusive relationship should probably always be on the abuser? Is there any responsibility on the abused to avoid triggering patterns? Is it just a nice to have? How about the abuser setting a boundary and then if the abused breaks that boundary he/she is in the wrong as well?
