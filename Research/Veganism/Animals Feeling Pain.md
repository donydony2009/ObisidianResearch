Recognition and Alleviation of Pain in Laboratory Animals. - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK32655/

Why do we care about animals in labs:
- funded by the public so the public should be able to choose   ?? what about private research?

Pain reduction methods:
 3 Rs - Replacement, Refinement, Reduction
  Replacement - Replace animals with something else
  Refinement - Improve the animals condition
  Reduction - Reduce the number of animals needed for gathering this info
  
Pain definition in humans: An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage
Pain usually involves noxious stimulus. Something to activate nociceptors in the body tissues that convey signals to the central nervous system where they are processed and generate multiple responses
including "umpleasant sensory and emotional experience"

Examples of stimuli:
 heat/cold
 tissue damage
 
The information is processed  at the central nervous system providing info about where the damage was, the intensity nature, duration

Pain effects / evidence:
 emotional state of pain
 withdrawal reflexes
 increased blood rate and blood pressure
 Direct communication for humans
 
Evidence:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK32655/box/ch1.box4/?report=objectonly - In summary, evidence for the conscious experience of pain is strong for mammals and birds, but conclusive studies are either in progress for other taxa such as fish or have not yet been conducted. Pending such needed research, this report treats all vertebrates as capable of experiencing pain
	
Argument for the reflexes:
	The reflexes like yelling and things that animals can do too.
	Are these evidence of a concious experience? Or are they merely reflexes.
	Does the supression of the reflexes imply the supression of pain?
	Which nociceptive responses indicate conscious pain and which are unconscious?
	
	Info:
		Which responses may not indicate concious pain?
			Categories:
			1. Responses can occur in organisms with no nervous system. Or a very limited one (muscle shells)
			2. In mamals whose forebrains are not receiving input from the periphery
			3. In humans whose pain has been supressed (e.g. by analgesics/anesthetics)
			
			Responses in humans that have no reported pain ( Lee et al. 2005; Dahl et al. 1992; see also Carrasco and Van de Kar 2003):
			 // In decerebrate dogs and rats Sherrington 1906, reviewed in Sivarao et al. 2007
			- Increased heart rate
			- Increased blood pressure
			- Pupil dilation
			- Increased cortisol levels (Cortisol levels are associated with all types of stress including trauma and infection)
			
			Simple avoidance responses:
			- Nonlearned avoidance responses are present in even simple single-celled organism and require no affect ((Rolls 2000; Tye 2007; Winkielman et al. 2005)
			- Withdrawal of body parts from noxious stimuly in decerebrated cats (Sherrington 1906) and spinal-transected cats and rats (e.g., Grau et al. 1998). 
			- In spinally transected cats, pinching or clamping the tail promotes stepping movements of the hindlimbs (Lovely et al. 1986), as though simple locomotory escape movements can occur even without pain
			- Some learned avoidance responses (e.g., classically conditioned withdrawal) have even been observed in the sea slug Aplysia (reviewed by Allen 2004).
			- Other research reveals the instrumental learning of avoidance responses normally associated with pain with no possible involvement of the brain: spinally transected rats learn to keep their limbs withdrawn for longer periods of time if doing so will terminate the insult (Grau et al. 1998).
			
			Other responses:
			???????????? - Turning the head towards the noxious stimuly, some vocalization, and the licking of the affected paws may occur in decerebrate animals  (Baliki et al. 2005; King et al. 2003; Sherrington 1906).
			~~ not clear, debated ~~ Cerebral blood flow increases during venipuncture in human fetuses as young as 16 weeks gestational age, even though the thalamocortical connections required for nociceptive input to reach the cortex have not developed (Lee et al. 2005). Isoflurane-anesthetized rats show activation in several forebrain regions (e.g., cingulate and insular cortices) in response to noxious stimuli applied to a paw (Hess et al. 2007).a
	
		Which responses indicate concious pain?
			How? - They can discriminate pain from non pain and make decisions based on that in a way that cannot arise from evolved nonconscious nociceptive responses, demonstrate motivations
			The discrimination of painful states. Rats can show that they can distinguish between an aspirine injection and a saline injection and furthermore rats with arthritis do this more readily (Weissman 1976; see also Colpaert 1978 and Swedberg et al. 1988)
			Rats press lever to self medicate and at a much higher rate than control animals. Denoting recognition of pain and want of aleviating said pain. (Control does not press the lever) (Martin et al. 2006)
			Animals press levers to avoid electrical shock pain (Carlsson et al. 2006))
			Research on self administration of pain medication has not been done for reptiles amphibians or fish
			But frogs fish and tadpoles exhibit avoidance to electrical shock Colpaert et al. 1980; Danbury et al. 2000

	Contra:
		You can trigger some refles on dead animals / humans. They do not imply pain. So why should we think for the others they do?

No pain:
 Carruthers 1996
 
Pro pain:
 Bateson 1991; 
 Sherwin 2001; 
 Tye 2007
