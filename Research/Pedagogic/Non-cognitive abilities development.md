#### What are non-cognitive abilities

- All abilities besides general inteligence/cognitive ability which proved to be good predictors for success and mental health ([[#^1|1]])
- "High skill in these abilities can make even a low intelligence person succeed while low skill in these abilities can make a high intelligence person fail" ([[^2|2]], [[^3|3]])
- The predictive value of these abilities in adolescence and adult life make them an important target ([[^4|4]], [[^5|5]])
- You can improve these skills in formal, non-formal or informal contexts and they do transfer in day to day life ([[^6|6]], [[^7|7]])
- The complexity of social interactions in the education system can strongly influence the development of these skills which are interconnected and they can be iteratively built ([[^8|8]], [[^9|9]])
