### Terms
- **Mediator** - a 3rd variable explaining the relationship between 2 other variables.
Ex: Independent variable: Exercise, Dependent variable: Weight loss, Mediator: Caloric expenditure. Caloric expenditure is a mediator because it explains how exercise reduces weight
- **Moderator** - a 3rd variable that affects the strength or direction between an independent and dependent variable. 
Ex: Independent variable: Exericse, Dependent variable: Weight loss, Moderator: Age. Age affects how much the exercise affects the weight.

### Results
Social media usage leads to body image concerns, eating disorders/disordered eating and poor mental health via the mediating pathways of **?social comparison?**, **?thin / fit ideal internalisation?**, and **?self-objectification?**. Specific exposures (social media trends, pro-eating disorder content, appearance focused platforms and investment in photos) and moderators (high BMI, female gender, and pre-existing body image concerns) strengthen the relationship, while other moderators (high social media literacy and body appreciation) are protective, hinting at a ‘self-perpetuating cycle of risk’.
