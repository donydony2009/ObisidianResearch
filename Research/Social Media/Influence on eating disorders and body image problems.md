### Terms
- **Mediator** - a 3rd variable explaining the relationship between 2 other variables.
Ex: Independent variable: Exercise, Dependent variable: Weight loss, Mediator: Caloric expenditure. Caloric expenditure is a mediator because it explains how exercise reduces weight
- **Moderator** - a 3rd variable that affects the strength or direction between an independent and dependent variable. 
Ex: Independent variable: Exericse, Dependent variable: Weight loss, Moderator: Age. Age affects how much the exercise affects the weight.

### Results
Social media usage leads to body image concerns, eating disorders/disordered eating and poor mental health via the mediating pathways of **?social comparison?**, **?thin / fit ideal internalisation?**, and **?self-objectification?**. Specific exposures (social media trends, pro-eating disorder content, appearance focused platforms and investment in photos) and moderators (high BMI, female gender, and pre-existing body image concerns) strengthen the relationship, while other moderators (high social media literacy and body appreciation) are protective, hinting at a ‘self-perpetuating cycle of risk’.

### Background in eating disorders

#### Eating disorders
- **Anorexia** - intense fear of weight gain and/or distrubed body image that motivates severe dietary restrictions
- **Bulimia** - episodes of binge eating and puking it
- **Binge eating disorder** - Episodes of compulsive overeating that leads to distress without attempts to compensate for it
- **Avoidant/restrivtive food intake** - the avoidance or restrictive intake of food in the absence of the body image concerns or fear of weight gain
- **Pica** - Eating non-nutritive or non food substances for long periods (more than a month)
- **Rumination disorders** - regurgitation of food after eating without any nausea, involuntary retching or disgust
- Etc (other subclinical)
#### Impact 

- 6-10% increase in years lived with disability ([[#^1|1]])
- Cardiovascular disease
- Reduced bone density
- Comorbid psychiatric conditions (depression, anxiety, OCD, specific phobias)
- In females one of the leading causes of disability often preceding amenorrhea, reduced fertility and adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.
- Anorexia has the highest mortality with only 50% of individuals fully recovering
