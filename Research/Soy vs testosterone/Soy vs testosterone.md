**Meta Analyses**

1. https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.reprotox.2020.12.019 - Neither soy nor isoflavone intake affects male reproductive hormones: An expanded and updated meta-analysis of clinical studies
- Avg in japan of isoflavone 30-50mg/d[1,2]
- Avg in US[3] and Europe [4] of isoflavone < 3mg/d
- 1g of soy protein is associated with 3.5mg of isoflavone[1]
- Isoflavone has a similar chemical structure to the hormone estrogen which allows them to bind to estrogen receptors (ER)[5,6]
- However, isoflavones differ from estrogen at the molecular level in that they preferentially bind to and activate ERβ in comparison to ERα whereas estrogen has equal affinity for both receptors [7-9]. This difference in binding preference is important because the two ERs have different tissue distributions and, when activated, can exert different and sometimes opposite physiological effects [10,11].

**Individual studies**
1. https://sci-hub.se/10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-06-0882 - Clinical and Biological Activity of Soy Protein Powder Supplementation in Healthy Male Volunteers
- 18 males no placebo ages -18-47 mean 31?- , 56g of protein powder
- "testosterone levels peak in the early morning and decrease by 25% to the evening minimum"
- "levels increase after exercise and decrease after immobilization and after glucose load"
- **! Study shows statistically significant decrease in testosterone**

2. https://sci-hub.se/https://www.nature.com/articles/1601495 - Dietary supplements of soya flour lower serum testosterone concentrations and improve markers of oxidative stress in men
- 20 males, placebo controlled, 120 mg/day of isoflavones by soya flour scones
-  **! Study shows statistically significant decrease in testosterone**


**Different legumes isoflavones**
