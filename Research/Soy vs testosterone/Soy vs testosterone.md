### Meta Analyses

1. https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.reprotox.2020.12.019 - Neither soy nor isoflavone intake affects male reproductive hormones: An expanded and updated meta-analysis of clinical studies
	- Avg in japan of isoflavone 30-50mg/d ([[Soy vs testosterone#^1|1]], [[#^2|2]]) 
	- Avg in US([[^3|3]]) and Europe ([[^4|4]]) of isoflavone < 3mg/d
	- 1g of soy protein is associated with 3.5mg of isoflavone ([[^1|1]])
	- Isoflavone has a similar chemical structure to the hormone estrogen which allows them to bind to estrogen receptors (ER)([[^5|5]], [[^6|6]])
	- However, isoflavones differ from estrogen at the molecular level in that they preferentially bind to and activate ERβ in comparison to ERα whereas estrogen has equal affinity for both receptors ([[^7|7-9]]). This difference in binding preference is important because the two ERs have different tissue distributions and, when activated, can exert different and sometimes opposite physiological effects ([[^10|10]],[[^11|11]]).
	- **! Conflict of interest. One of the researcher regularly consults soy product producers. Messina is the name**

7. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068331 - Short-Term Soy Isoflavone Intervention in Patients with Localized Prostate Cancer: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial
	- 86 men, age 50-84, 2 groups 1 placebo one isoflavones 
	- - **! Study doesn't find a statistically significant change in testosterone .**
8. https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/s41598-018-29591-4 - Soy protein supplementation is not androgenic or estrogenic in collegeaged men when combined with resistance exercise training
	- 47 men, age 19-21, 3 groups, soy, whey, placebo,
	- 12 weeks
	- There is evidence whey or soy protein supplementation may afect sex hormone signaling mechanisms
	- In terms of muscle growth no significant difference was observed between the 3 groups
	-  **! Study doesn't find a statistically significant change in testosterone . But there was a small not statistically significant decrease in testosterone in soy ppl despite exercise being linked generally with an increase. Additionally for whey there was a big increase in testostrone**
9. https://sci-hub.se/10.1186/1550-2783-4-4 - Effect of protein source and resistance training on body composition and sex hormones
	- 20 men, age 18-40, 4 groups: soy concentrate soy isolate, whey blend, and 50:50 soy+whey, 138mg/day of isoflavone, 49mg/d and 28mg/d
	- 12 weeks
	- Soy concentrate had a concentration of 2.7x higher isoflavones vs soy isolate and the mix was half of the soy isolate(concentrate:276mg/100g, isolate: 98mg/100g, mix: 48mg/100g)
	-  **! Study doesn't find a statistically significant change in testosterone. BUT in the soy concentrate group (max isoflavones) there was a small not statistically significant decrease in testosterone. Also big increases in Soy isolate and the mix.**
--------------------------------------------
**At this point I am no longer gonna look at prostate cancer studies. Seems pretty clear to me that in aging men there is not much of a influence of testosterone by isoflavones**
